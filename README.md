## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important notice (please read!)

This submod is no longer mantained as of Monika After Story's recent update (v0.12.12). I, Otter, the main dev, decided to stop creating submods and focusing on working on the main mod, Monika After Story. It has always been my dream to focus on contributing officially and it's wonderful to be able to actually do that. Thank you so much for your support so far and all the kind and appreciative words. Also thanks for the understanding. You can follow my work in the future MAS official mod releases. 

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important notice number 2 (please read!)

This submod is designed to help people that harm themselves in some way
as well as to raise awareness and provide some insights for people who are
willing to learn more about this phenomenon in particular.

**However**, original authors, contributors and repository maintainers
do not condone self-harm, suicide or any other (self-)destructive behavior
**nor provide the ideal professional psychological help**.

If you're currently experiencing a need in psychological/psychiatric help,
**please consider getting professional help from people working with this
sort of issues specifically** as this mod is **not intended as a medical,
psychological or any other sort of professional advice**; its only purpose
is to bring awareness about self-harm or verbally support people
going through hard times.
