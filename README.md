## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important notice

This submod is designed to help people that harm themselves in some way
as well as to raise awareness and provide some insights for people who are
willing to learn more about this phenomenon in particular.

**However**, original authors, contributors, and repository maintainers
do not condone self-harm, suicide, or any other (self-)destructive behavior
**nor provide the ideal professional psychological help**.

If you're currently experiencing a need for psychological/psychiatric help,
**please consider getting professional help from people working with this
sort of issues specifically** as this mod is **not intended as a medical,
psychological or any other sort of professional advice**; its only purpose
is to bring awareness about self-harm or verbally support people
going through hard times.

If you desperately need help, seek professional psychological, psychiatrical
or other appropriate help; there's always hope!

## ü§î FAQ & Troubleshooting

> [!WARNING]
> This section may contain spoilers to the submod content/topics.
> It probably isn't *quite* important when you're facing a problem, but still.

### Monika's playlist doesn't play!

Make sure you installed the mod correctly, following the instructions on the
[release page](https://github.com/friends-of-monika/mas-selfharm/releases/latest).
Namely, path to the submod in your game folder must look *exactly* like this:<br>
`(your DDLC folder) > game > Submods > Self Harm Awareness Submod`

Please mind the uppercase `S` in `Submods` and that there are no duplicated
folders (like `game > game`) and you *have downloaded the submod from the releases page.*

*Please. So many people keep trying to install development version of the submod
by pressing that green/blue 'Code' button instead of following the guide. Please
follow the guide instead.*

### Monika keeps saying the same topic over and over in a loop!

This *was* a known bug that existed for a while until versions 2.0.3 and 2.0.4;
if you have double checked that your submod version is the latest, please
[create an issue](https://github.com/Friends-of-Monika/mas-selfharm/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug-report.yml&title=Bug%3A+)

*No, seriously. We couldn't ever reproduce it. Please give us some info if you can.*
