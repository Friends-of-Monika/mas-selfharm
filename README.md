## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important notice

This submod is designed to help people that harm themselves in some way
as well as to raise awareness and provide some insights for people who are
willing to learn more about this phenomenon in particular.

**However**, original authors, contributors and repository maintainers
do not condone self-harm, suicide or any other (self-)destructive behavior
**nor provide the ideal professional psychological help**.

If you're currently experiencing a need in psychological/psychiatric help,
**please consider getting professional help from people working with this
sort of issues specifically** as this mod is **not intended as a medical,
psychological or any other sort of professional advice**; its only purpose
is to bring awareness about self-harm or verbally support people
going through hard times.

If you desperately need help, seek professional psychological, psychiatrical
or other appropriate help; there's always hope!
