*** Happy 1st release anniversary! ***

Starting from this version, submod is now named Self-Harm Awareness Submod!
Unfortunately, we have to deprecate previous submod versions in order to simplify
our work at transitioning from Otter's MAS Self-Harm Submod and perform major
reworks in code, topics and submod logic (both now, and in future)

Contributions:
- Typo fixes and spell/grammar check. Thanks, @Survivor-2-22-22! Grace will be proud of you~
- Fixed issue with SIAD date sometimes not working as expected (#1). Thanks, @Chamelllemon!
- Fixed a long-lasting issue with Monika's Playlist not playing properly. Much appreciated, @â€‹Rainy Day!

Other changes:
- Project transition finished, all missing resources, credits and content were recovered
- Updated the submod header to now reference this (Friends-of-Monika/mas-selfharm) repository
- Now using Timers and Reminders API for improved and more stable reminder work
- Reformatted spritepack JSON files
- Healthy routine topics are now unlocked sequentially, not randomly
- First aid is now in self-harm category
