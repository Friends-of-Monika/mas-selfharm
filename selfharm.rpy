# MARCH 1ST DIALOGUE - SELF HARM AWARENESS DAY

# (Reminder that you can use this either ways, before or after the question of Player's self harm)
# (code so this shows up on march 1st)

    m "[Player], did you know that today is Self-Harm Awareness day?"
    m "Like the name suggests, it's an annual global awareness event that takes place on March 1st!"
    m "Also known as Self Injury Day (SIAD)!"
    m "Which is today!"
    m "And in the weeks leading up to it and after, some people choose to be more open about their own self-harm habits, if they have them..."
    m "Awareness organizations make special efforts to raise awareness about self-harm and self-injury."
    m "People even use the hashtag #SelfInjuryAwarenessDay to share their story on social media."
    m "Or wear orange to show their support!"
    m "Moreover, it was also created to spread awareness and understanding of self-injury!"
    m "Which is often misrepresented and misunderstood in the mainstream."
    m "Those who self-harm are often left feeling alone..."
    m "And afraid to reach out for help, because they fear they will be seen as "crazy"."
    m "When in reality that's not even remotely true..."
    m "People are just trying to cope with their feelings..."
    m "Which can be a result of this terrible thing."
    m "You know I tried it before..."
    m "But self-harm is not the way."
    m "Anyway! Thanks for listening!"
    m "I love you, [Player]!"
    
# SEMICOLON PROJECT

    m "Did you ever heard of The Semicolon Project, [player]?"
    m "It was created for those who were going through struggles with self-harm, depression and suicide..."
    m "People who could have stopped moving forward, but refused to do so!"
    m "But to thousands affected by suicide, the semicolon has become an important signifier of survival."
    m "Like a symbol!"
    m "There's also semicolon tattoos, semicolon t-shirts..."
    m "All of them with the semicolon punctuation mark (;)!"
    m "It's used as a message of affirmation and solidarity against suicide, depression, addiction, and other mental health issues."
    m "The reason the semicolon was used as the symbol of the movement was because..."
    m ""A semicolon is used when an author could've chosen to end their sentence, but chose not to. The author is you and the sentence is your life"."
    m "As said by the project itself!"
    m "Project Semicolon was founded by Amy Bleuel in 2013, as a tribute to her father, who died by suicide in 2003."
    m "Her backstory is so sad..."
    m "But thanks to her, millions are saved by Project Semicolon."
    m "It's relieving to think people are able to go on and let go of their struggles..."
    m "It's really a good cause!"
    m "Well I won't ramble too much, Ahaha~"
    m "Thanks for listening!"
