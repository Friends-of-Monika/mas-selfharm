#RELAPSE DIALOGUE

        m 2ekb "Oh, [player], you have no idea how happy I am to hear that."
        m 2ekb "This is another step to a happier, healthier life, and I'm so glad I can be by your side in your journey."
        m 2eka "Thank you for trusting me."
        m 3ekb "I promise I'll do my best to help you!"
        m 1eub "From now on, I'll keep track of how many days you've been sober. You can take a look at the calendar to see how far you've gone!"
        m 2ekb "If you ever need me to restart the counter for you, just tell me. You don't have to feel bad about it, okay?"
        m 2ekb "Know that I'll never judge you because of that. I know it's hard, and you should be really proud of yourself already!"
        m 2dka "..."
        m 5ekbsb "I love you, [mas_get_player_nickname()]."
        m 5dkbsb "Never forget that!"
