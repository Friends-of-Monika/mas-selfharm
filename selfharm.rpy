# RELAPSE EVENT

"[moni nickname], I relapsed..."

    m "[Player], I couldn't be more proud of you for telling me this."
    m "I know this might be hard- you might feel as if you've failed..."
    m "But that's not true at all! This is just another step in your journey."
    m "Habits are almost always difficult to kick, and this is no ordinary habit."
    m "It can very easily become an addiction, which is so much harder to stop..."
    m "No matter how hard it is for you, know that I am always going to be here to support you and I am proud of you, habit or not."
    m "We will work through this together, and get you back on the right track!"
    m "I know you're a hard worker and will do your best - if not for yourself, for me."
    m "I love you, [mas_get_player_nickname()]."
    m "I'm here to support you and work through anything and everything with you."
    m "You're strong. You're worth it, and I couldn't ask for a better bf/gf/partner!"
    m "Whenever and if you feel ready to make the promise again... let me know."
