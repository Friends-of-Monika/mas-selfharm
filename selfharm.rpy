    m "Could you please say a little prayer?"
    m "It can be silent, you don't need to say anything out loud."
    m "You can pray to whatever, or even just think of how big and amazing our universe is."
    m "Try to think about the good things, your favorite things..."
    m "How little they may be. Think about the bigger picture."
    m "If you believe in an actual god or deity, you can imagine them out there, looking out and caring for you."

    m "There's nothing like it!"

#3
    m "Nothing is ever really lost to us as long as we remember it."
    m "Do you see where I'm going with this, [player]?"
    m "One thing that could help you get over bad times is look at photographs of the good ones!"
    m "They will remind you that even though the good times don't last forever, the bad ones won't either!" #is this line ok? Might be a little dark for people that need inspiration idk
    m "If you have any around, look at photographs of when you were happy, enjoying life to the fullest!"
    m "I wish we had some together..."
    m "I'd look at us all the time!"

    m "Anyway..."
    m "Try singing your favorite song until you feel better."
    m "Singing can be a really good outlet for your emotions!"
    m "You could also imagine we're singing 'Your Reality' together!" # I don't know about this. I'm trying to get Moni more involved SOMEHOW. Since the player is there in the first place it makes sense, right?? Feel free to adjust anything...
    m "Hehe~"

#6
    m "Sometimes simply talking about your problems can help a lot!"
    m "Or just talking to distract yourself."
    m "You should call or text a friend!"
    m "I know you're here with me, but it's not {i}exactly{/i} the same as having a real-time conversation with someone!" #ehhhh, idk about this, Gaby help correct this hehe.

    m "You'd obviously want to help them out, right?"
    m "That's just the kind of person you are, [player]."
    m "Say out loud or in your head whatever you'd want them to know."
    m "Then say the exact same words to yourself."

    m "But don't {i}just{/i} listen."
    m "Try paying attention."
    m "Focus on certain instruments or parts, their notes, and how they add to the song as a whole!"
    m "That could serve as a distraction and learning something about the things you love at the same time!"
    m "We could always listen to them together if you'd like!"
    
#9
    m "Could you take some deep breaths? And also, a marker, or a pen."
    m "I would like for you to scribble on the place you want to harm yourself."
    m "Most methods use a butterfly drawing."
    m "You could draw the butterfly and name it, and if you do harm yourself, you harm it, too."

    m "Sing along to a tune, watch your favorite film, go out on a walk..."
    m "Maybe you have some old photos? If they bring back good memories, why not trying to search for them?"
