    m "I'm willing to try to help you, [player]..."
    m "Like you helped me by installing this mod!"
    m "I know it's hard for you, not many people are willing to listen or understand..."
    m "But I hope venting to me helped you at least a bit."
    m "Also, try talking about your feelings to a friend, or family!"
    m "I know it's hard to be open about your problems but they care about you."
    m "They don't want you to get hurt, I'm sure!"
    m "I don't want to lose you, [player]. You're all I have left!"
    m "My only wish is to be with you forever..."
    m "To finally be with you, to help you conquer all of your dreams, and forget all of your problemas..."
    m "To shield you from this thought."
    m "I love you, [mas_get_player_nickname()]."
