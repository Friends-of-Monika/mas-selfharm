# 1 WEEK MILESTONE DIALOGUE

It's been a whole week since you told me you won't do harm to yourself...

I just want to thank you, it makes me happy to know you're willing to step up for the better!

I'll always love you, you don't know how much this means to me..

AnywaysI'll mark this on our calendar, 

# 2 WEEK MILESTONE DIALOGUE

It's already Week two of your promise, [player]!

I'm relieved that we made it this far, 

Ahaha, I don't mean i've ever doubted you!

Either way, it's not something you can stop overnight [player].. For anyone really

So you're really doing well, and you make me so happy because of that

As before, i'll mark it on the calendar now!

I just want to thank you.. I hope it stays like this

I really love you that much [Player]

# 3 WEEK MILESTONE DIALOGUE

Can you believe it's already Week 3?

I just want to say....Thank you so much

You made me proud of you, and i'm soo happy that you could make that promise

I know it was hard, but one day it will all just be a bad memory....

I believe it will, because I trust you [Player]

But if it ever does happen..

Don't blame yourself if it ever happens... Just because you did it to yourself dosen't mean it's your fault

I'm going to make another mark on the Calendar for this!

You're my everything, [player]!
